# TwoDSurvival - Project Instructions

## Progress Tracking

Whenever a task is completed, update `PROGRESS.md` at the project root by appending a new row to the table with:
- The next sequential task number
- A brief description of what was done
- Today's date
- Any relevant notes

Do this automatically after completing each task — the user should not have to ask.
