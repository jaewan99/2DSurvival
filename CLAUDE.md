# TwoDSurvival - Project Instructions

## Game Concept

- **Genre**: 2D Platformer Survival
- **Camera**: Side-scrolling (2D view) — camera faces the character from the side, movement is left/right
- **Perspective**: Orthographic-style side view using a Spring Arm + Camera setup on the BaseCharacter

## Progress Tracking

Whenever a task is completed, update `PROGRESS.md` at the project root by appending a new row to the table with:
- The next sequential task number
- A brief description of what was done
- Today's date
- Any relevant notes

Do NOT update PROGRESS.md automatically. Instead, ask the user for confirmation that the task is fully complete before adding it. A task may require multiple steps or iterations before it's done.
